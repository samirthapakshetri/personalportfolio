            <div>Behaviour<div class="paragraph1">This guy is 20 but acts like he's 14. A pro at procrastination, he's lazy now and productive 
              later—only if it’s absolutely necessary. He’s also pretty gullible, trusting people too easily.Sometimes he shows great intelligence,
               other times he is dull.He has a serious addiction to do something or ... well, doing nothing. </div></div>
            <div>Strength<div class="paragraph1">This guy is great at finishing tasks last minute, can survive  doing nothing for hours, and 
              sleeping anytime. He may delay work,Samir’s strengths? He’s a last-minute genius, a pro at doing nothing for hours, and an expert 
              at sleeping anytime, anywhere. Deadlines may scare him, but he always pulls through—just in time!</div></div>
            <div>Mindset<div class="paragraph1">This guy has a "say yes, then figure it out" mindset. He’s always ready to help
                others succeed and make a difference in their lives. He is lazy sometimes, but always gets things done when needed!.
                He’s as curious as a monkey, always exploring and asking questions, and as disciplined as a dog when it really
                matters.</div>
